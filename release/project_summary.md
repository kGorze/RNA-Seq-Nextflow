# RNA-Seq Nextflow Pipeline Project Summary

## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive RNA-Seq analysis pipeline using Nextflow. The pipeline provides end-to-end processing of RNA-Seq data from raw reads to differential expression results, with comprehensive reporting at each step.

## Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Each step is implemented as a separate module for flexibility and maintainability
- **Multiple Tool Options**: Support for different aligners (STAR, HISAT2) and quantification methods (Salmon, featureCounts)
- **Containerization**: Docker containers for reproducible execution across environments
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed HTML reports and visualizations of results
- **Scalability**: Efficient resource usage with Nextflow's execution engine
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing and deployment with GitHub Actions

## Directory Structure

- **bin/**: Utility scripts for testing and data preparation
- **conf/**: Configuration files for different execution environments
- **docker/**: Dockerfiles and container build scripts
- **modules/**: Nextflow process modules for each pipeline component
- **.github/workflows/**: CI/CD workflow definitions
- **scripts/**: R scripts for analysis and visualization
- **test_data*/**: Test datasets for pipeline validation
