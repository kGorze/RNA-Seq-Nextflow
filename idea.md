## Project Idea: A Reproducible RNA-Seq Pipeline in Nextflow

### Overview

**Objective**: Build a Nextflow pipeline that takes raw FASTQ files from an RNA-Seq experiment, performs quality control, read alignment, transcript quantification, and differential expression analysis, then outputs final result files and reports. 

**Why RNA-Seq**:
1. **Common use-case**: RNA-seq is one of the most ubiquitous workflows in bioinformatics.
2. **Demonstrates breadth**: It touches on key tasks—quality control, alignment/quantification, statistical analysis, and reporting.
3. **Easily extends**: You can add modules (e.g., multiQC, additional QC steps, or other analyses) without too much complexity.

By the end, you’ll have:
1. **A public GitHub repo** with your Nextflow pipeline code, including 
   - Documentation (Markdown or Sphinx)  
   - Example dataset or instructions on how to obtain it  
   - Dockerfiles or Singularity definitions (if you choose to create your own container)  
   - A CI/CD setup (GitHub Actions) that tests basic functionality  
2. **A blog post** (on Medium, Dev.to, or your personal website) explaining the pipeline architecture, how to run it, and interesting observations from the results. 
3. **A mention on your CV** to demonstrate practical Nextflow experience.

## Suggested Architecture

Below is a high-level outline of what the pipeline might do. Adapt it to fit your preferences or domain knowledge.

1. **Input:**
   - FASTQ files (paired-end or single-end).  
   - A reference genome or transcriptome FASTA.  
   - (Optional) Gene annotations (GTF or GFF3).  

2. **Quality Control:**
   - **FastQC** (or **MultiQC** for aggregated reports).  

3. **Trimming (if needed):**
   - **Trimmomatic** or **Cutadapt** to remove low-quality bases and adapters.

4. **Alignment/Quantification:**
   - If you want a *reference-based approach*: use **STAR** or **HISAT2** for alignment, then **featureCounts** or **HTSeq-count** for gene-level quantification.
   - If you want a *pseudo-alignment approach*: use **Salmon** or **Kallisto** for transcript-level quantification.

5. **Differential Expression Analysis:**
   - **R** with **DESeq2** or **edgeR**.  
   - The pipeline can automatically launch R scripts that read in the count matrix and produce DE results.

6. **Reporting:**
   - Use **MultiQC** to collect logs from FastQC, alignment, and counting steps into a single report.  
   - Generate a final HTML or PDF report of the differential expression analysis (e.g., using Rmarkdown).

7. **Output:**
   - QC reports (FastQC/MultiQC outputs).
   - BAM files and count matrices (if aligned approach).
   - Log files (to help debug or monitor pipeline steps).
   - Differential expression results (e.g., CSV with fold changes and p-values).

## Nextflow Implementation Details

1. **Pipeline Configurations**:
   - **`main.nf`**: Contains the main workflow code (process definitions and workflow steps).
   - **`nextflow.config`**: Set default parameters, container definitions, environment variables, or HPC config.  
   - **Profiles**: For example, define a local profile for running on your laptop, and a separate profile for AWS or GCP.

2. **Processes**:
   - Each step (FastQC, trimming, alignment, etc.) should be in its own process block.
   - Ensure you’re using Nextflow’s channel semantics to pass outputs from one step to the next.

3. **Containers**:
   - You can use Docker images from [BioContainers](https://biocontainers.pro/) or create your own if you want to demonstrate Dockerfile writing skills.
   - Alternatively, show how the pipeline can run with either Docker or Singularity.

4. **Version Control & CI/CD**:
   - Host on GitHub.
   - Set up GitHub Actions to run a minimal test dataset whenever you push or open a pull request.  
   - A small synthetic dataset or a truncated example FASTQ can serve as the test set.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Include a **`README.md`** explaining how to run the pipeline locally or on the cloud.  
   - Possibly include usage examples with command-line parameters (e.g., `-profile docker --reads '/path/to/reads/*.fastq.gz' --genome 'ref.fasta' …`).  

6. **(Optional) Cloud Integration**:
   - Show you can launch the pipeline on AWS or Google Cloud.  
   - If possible, mention how to use Nextflow Tower or Nextflow Cloud for easy orchestration and monitoring.  
   - This step could be out of scope if you just want a simpler local/HPC demonstration, but it’s a nice plus.

## Example Steps To Implement

1. **Repository Setup** 
   - Create a new GitHub repo: `my-rnaseq-nextflow-pipeline`
   - Initialize with a `README.md` that states the purpose of the pipeline, the tools used, and how to cite them.

2. **Minimal Test Data**
   - Add a folder `test_data/` containing small FASTQ reads (maybe subset from a public dataset), plus a small reference genome or transcriptome.  
   - Mention in the docs that these are for demonstration only and not a full dataset.

3. **Core Nextflow Script** (`main.nf`)
   - Begin with processes for:
     1. FastQC
     2. Trimming  
     3. Alignment or Pseudo-alignment  
     4. Counting or Quantification  
   - End with a process that uses R to run a DE analysis script.

4. **R Script** for DE Analysis
   - In a separate file (e.g., `scripts/DE_analysis.R`), read the count matrix, run DESeq2, and generate an HTML/PDF summary.

5. **MultiQC** Integration
   - Add a process that aggregates all logs and QC metrics.  

6. **Containerization**
   - Use a Docker image that has the necessary tools (FastQC, STAR/HISAT2, Salmon, etc.). You can either write your own Dockerfile or use existing images:
     ```dockerfile
     FROM continuumio/miniconda3
     RUN conda install -c bioconda fastqc star ...
     ```
   - In `nextflow.config`, set `docker.enabled = true` and specify `docker.image = 'myuser/my-rnaseq-docker:latest'`.

7. **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**
   - Create `.github/workflows/test-pipeline.yml` that does something like:
     ```yaml
     name: Test Pipeline
     on: [push, pull_request]
     jobs:
       test:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - uses: actions/checkout@v2
           - name: Install Nextflow
             run: |
               wget -qO- https://get.nextflow.io | bash
           - name: Run test dataset
             run: |
               ./nextflow run main.nf -profile test,docker
     ```
   - The key is to run the pipeline on a small test dataset quickly.

8. **Documentation & Blog Post**
   - In your `README.md`, show how to run the pipeline with different profiles (e.g., local vs. Docker).
   - Write a blog post describing:
     1. The motivation behind building this pipeline.  
     2. Architecture of the pipeline (diagram of processes).  
     3. Example usage commands.  
     4. Link to results from a test dataset (screenshots of MultiQC or differential expression plots).  
     5. Discussion about performance, containerization, etc.

9. **Polish & Additional Features** (Optional Enhancements)
   - Add containerization for R + DESeq2 if not included in the main Docker image.
   - Implement parameterization so the pipeline can handle single-end or paired-end reads, different aligners, or specify reference versions as command-line parameters.
   - Explore Nextflow’s DSL2 modules for a more modular design.

### Next Steps

1. **Pick Your Dataset**: For example, use a small subset of public data from GEO/SRA (e.g., a few runs from an experiment you find interesting).
2. **Start with a Minimal Workflow**: Maybe just QC and alignment initially. Then expand to counting and differential expression.
3. **Add Docker**: Build or pull a container that has your tools installed.
4. **Test & Polish**: Make sure each step runs with the test data. 
5. **Add CI**: Create a simple GitHub Actions workflow to run tests on push/pull requests.
6. **Write the Blog Post**: Summarize your design decisions, challenges encountered, and results.

## Final Tip

Remember, it’s not just about *having* a Nextflow pipeline on GitHub—**it’s about telling the story** of how you built it, why you made certain decisions, and what you learned. That narrative is incredibly powerful for your portfolio and demonstrates to potential employers that you’ve got genuine, hands-on experience with Nextflow and modern bioinformatics workflows.

Good luck with your RNA-seq Nextflow pipeline project! If RNA-seq doesn’t excite you, you can substitute another genomics workflow (e.g., DNA variant calling or 16S microbiome analysis), but the general approach remains the same.
