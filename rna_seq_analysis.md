# RNA-Seq Pipeline Analysis

## Pipeline Architecture Overview

The RNA-Seq pipeline will follow a modular design with the following main components:

1. **Quality Control**
   - Tool: FastQC for individual sample QC
   - Tool: MultiQC for aggregated reports
   - Purpose: Assess read quality, adapter content, sequence duplication

2. **Read Trimming**
   - Tool: Trimmomatic
   - Purpose: Remove low-quality bases and adapter sequences

3. **Alignment/Quantification**
   - Option 1 (Reference-based approach):
     - Alignment: STAR (faster) or HISAT2 (more memory-efficient)
     - Quantification: featureCounts for gene-level counting
   - Option 2 (Pseudo-alignment approach):
     - Tool: Salmon for transcript-level quantification
     - Advantages: Faster, requires less computational resources

4. **Differential Expression Analysis**
   - Tool: R with DESeq2
   - Purpose: Identify differentially expressed genes between conditions
   - Output: Tables with fold changes, p-values, and visualizations

5. **Reporting**
   - Tool: MultiQC for aggregating QC metrics
   - Tool: R Markdown for generating differential expression reports

## Nextflow Implementation Strategy

1. **DSL2 Approach**
   - Use Nextflow DSL2 for modular workflow design
   - Create separate module files for each process
   - Enable easy process reuse and pipeline customization

2. **Channel Design**
   - Input channel: FASTQ files (paired-end or single-end)
   - Reference channels: Genome FASTA, annotation GTF
   - Process channels: Connect outputs from one process to inputs of the next

3. **Process Structure**
   - Each bioinformatics tool will be encapsulated in its own process
   - Processes will specify:
     - Input/output channels
     - Resource requirements (CPU, memory)
     - Container directives
     - Script section with tool commands

4. **Configuration**
   - Main config file with default parameters
   - Profile-specific configs (local, HPC, cloud)
   - Container specifications

## Containerization Strategy

1. **Docker Containers**
   - Use BioContainers when available
   - Create custom containers when necessary
   - Ensure reproducibility across environments

2. **Container Options**
   - Support both Docker and Singularity
   - Enable container selection via profiles

## CI/CD Implementation

1. **GitHub Actions**
   - Test workflow on minimal dataset
   - Verify container builds
   - Check code formatting and linting

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Create synthetic or subsampled test data
   - Verify each process individually
   - Test full pipeline integration

## Documentation Plan

1. **README.md**
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage examples
   - Parameter descriptions
   - Output explanations

2. **Blog Post Structure**
   - Introduction to RNA-Seq analysis
   - Pipeline architecture explanation
   - Implementation details and challenges
   - Example results and visualizations
   - Performance considerations

## Technical Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Memory usage for alignment tools
   - Parallelization strategies
   - Resource allocation recommendations

2. **Flexibility**
   - Support for both paired-end and single-end reads
   - Multiple alignment/quantification options
   - Customizable parameters

3. **Error Handling**
   - Robust input validation
   - Comprehensive error messages
   - Failure recovery options

## Implementation Decisions

1. **Alignment Approach**: Will implement both reference-based (STAR + featureCounts) and pseudo-alignment (Salmon) approaches, with the ability to select via parameters.

2. **R Integration**: Will use Nextflow's ability to execute R scripts for differential expression analysis, passing count matrices from previous steps.

3. **Reporting**: Will generate both technical QC reports (MultiQC) and biological results reports (R Markdown).

4. **Container Strategy**: Will primarily use BioContainers for tools, with a custom container for R analysis to ensure all required packages are available.
